#  My Profile Web Page with Contact Form and Calculator

This project is a simple, interactive, and responsive profile webpage created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It represents a personal branding profile for myself ‚Äî **Seher Sanghani** ‚Äî and includes both form interaction and basic arithmetic functionality. The project was built from scratch as part of my web development learning journey and combines clean UI design with basic JavaScript interactivity to demonstrate practical frontend development skills.

## üí° Project Motivation

As someone diving deeper into frontend development, I wanted to create a webpage that not only looks visually pleasing but also incorporates real-life interactivity using JavaScript. This led to the creation of this personal profile project where users can:

- Read about me (profile header)
- Submit their contact information via a form
- Perform simple arithmetic calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division

This project serves as a foundation for more advanced projects later on and reflects my understanding of form validation, DOM manipulation, and interactive UI design.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the web page
- **CSS3**: For layout, colors, styling, and visual hierarchy
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: For dynamic form submission and calculator logic
- **Google Fonts**: For modern typography
- **Font Awesome Icons**: For replacing emojis with professional icons (like user, envelope, calculator, etc.)

## üîç Features

### 1. **Profile Header**
- Includes my name and a subtitle
- Uses a clean serif font with a subtle background
- Uses a Font Awesome user icon for aesthetics

### 2. **Contact Me Section**
- A responsive contact form with fields for:
  - Name
  - Email
  - Phone
- A submit button that:
  - Prevents page reload using `preventDefault()`
  - Displays a "Form submitted successfully!" message for 3 seconds
  - Automatically clears the form fields after submission
  - Hides the success message after 3 seconds using `setTimeout()`

### 3. **Simple Calculator Section**
- Two number input fields
- Four operation buttons:
  - Add
  - Subtract
  - Multiply
  - Divide
- Shows result dynamically in the result paragraph
- Handles divide-by-zero error gracefully

### 4. **Responsive Design**
- The webpage is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes
- Uses a container with a maximum width to maintain readability

## üß† What I Learned

This project helped me reinforce core frontend concepts like:

- HTML form structure and form handling
- JavaScript event listeners (`addEventListener`)
- Input validation and DOM manipulation
- Clearing and resetting form fields
- Dynamically updating UI without reloading
- Writing clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Using external resources like Font Awesome and Google Fonts

I also learned how to give the user **instant feedback** (like showing a message after form submission), which improves UX and feels more real-world.
